Prompt Template — “30s Flow Script Structure”

Prompt:

You are an expert short-form video scriptwriter.
Create a 30-second AI video script divided into four segments (Segment 1 = 0–8s, Segment 2 = 8–16s, Segment 3 = 16–24s, Segment 4 = 24–30s).

Each segment must:

Flow naturally from the previous one (no hard cuts in tone or idea).

Include scene description (background, mood, lighting).

Include voiceover lines that match the pacing of that time frame (about 20–25 words per 8s).

Include on-screen text or subtitle cues (short and engaging).

Maintain one consistent theme or story.

End Segment 4 with a smooth closing or call-to-action.
